        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Last updated: April 3, 2025</p>

        <p>Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the "Customized Greeter" Discord bot. We want to make it clear that we do not collect, store, or share any personal data from users or Discord servers using our bot.</p>

        <h3>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>The Customized Greeter bot does not collect or store any personal information from users, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Discord user ID or any personal data.</li>
            <li>Messages or any other content from your Discord server.</li>
            <li>Any logs or usage data related to how you use the bot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Since the bot operates purely on the front end within your Discord server, all processing happens locally and does not involve any data collection, transmission, or storage on our servers. The bot only interacts with the server to display customized greeting messages, and once the interaction is over, no data is retained.</p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>We do not use any third-party services that collect, store, or process your data. The bot operates independently and does not share your data with anyone.</p>

        <h3>4. Security</h3>
        <p>As we do not collect or store any personal information, there are no security risks associated with data breaches. Your data remains completely within your Discord server, and once the interaction is complete, no data is saved or logged.</p>

        <h3>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. As always, we are committed to ensuring the privacy and safety of your data.</p>
