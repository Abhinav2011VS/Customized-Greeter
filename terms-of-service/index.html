        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>Last updated: April 3, 2025</p>

        <p>By using the "Customized Greeter" Discord bot (the "Service"), you agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read these terms carefully. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the bot.</p>

        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using the Customized Greeter bot, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our bot.</p>

        <h3>2. Service Description</h3>
        <p>The Customized Greeter bot allows Discord server owners to customize greeting messages for new members joining their server. The bot operates entirely on the front end, meaning no personal data or server data is collected or stored. The bot only interacts with Discord to customize the greeting experience for your server.</p>

        <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>As a user of the bot, you agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the bot for any illegal activities or to violate Discord's Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>Interfere with the proper operation of the bot or attempt to tamper with it.</li>
            <li>Misuse the bot to send spam, offensive content, or engage in harassment.</li>
            <li>Impersonate anyone else or attempt to harm the bot or its functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. No Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from the users or Discord servers using the bot. All interactions are purely for the purpose of customizing greetings and are processed locally within your Discord server without any data being stored externally.</p>

        <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>All intellectual property rights to the bot, including its code, design, and any related materials, are owned by Customized Greeter. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use the bot within the terms of this agreement.</p>

        <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>The bot is provided "as is," without any warranties. We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the bot, including but not limited to errors, interruptions, or technical issues.</p>

        <h3>7. Termination</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the bot if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Service. You may also terminate your use of the Service at any time by removing the bot from your Discord server.</p>

        <h3>8. Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Customized Greeter, its affiliates, and its employees from any claims or liabilities arising from your use of the bot or violation of these Terms of Service.</p>

        <h3>9. Changes to Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and it is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically.</p>

        <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction. Any disputes will be handled in the appropriate legal forum for your jurisdiction.</p>
